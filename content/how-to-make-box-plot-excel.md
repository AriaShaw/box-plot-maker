# How to Make a Box and Whisker Plot in Excel: Step-by-Step Guide (2025)

Box and whisker plots are powerful tools for visualizing data distribution, identifying outliers, and comparing multiple datasets at a glance. While Excel offers box plot functionality, many users find the process unnecessarily complicated and time-consuming. This comprehensive guide shows you exactly how to make a box and whisker plot in Excel, plus reveals a much easier free alternative that works on any device.

Whether you're a student analyzing research data, an office worker creating reports, or a data analyst visualizing statistics, you'll learn the complete process and discover why thousands of users are switching to simpler online tools.

## What You'll Need Before Starting

Before creating your Excel box plot, ensure you have:

**Excel Version Requirements:**
- Excel 2016 or later (Windows/Mac)
- Excel 365 (subscription version)
- Excel 2019

**Important:** Excel 2013 and earlier versions do NOT have built-in box and whisker plot functionality. If you're using an older version, skip to the "Free Online Alternative" section below.

**Data Format Requirements:**
- Data organized in columns or rows
- Numerical values only
- At least 5 data points per dataset (recommended)
- Headers for each dataset (optional but helpful)

## Step-by-Step: How to Create a Box Plot in Excel

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Open Excel and organize your data in columns. Each column represents a different dataset you want to compare.

**Example data structure:**
```
Test A    Test B    Test C
65        72        68
78        85        74
82        79        81
90        88        86
75        82        79
88        91        85
```

Make sure there are no empty cells within your data ranges, as this can cause chart errors.

### Step 2: Select Your Data Range

Click and drag to highlight all the data you want to include in your box and whisker plot. Include column headers if you have them - Excel will use these as series names in your chart.

**Pro tip:** Hold Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) to select non-adjacent columns if your data isn't side-by-side.

### Step 3: Insert the Box and Whisker Chart

1. Navigate to the **Insert** tab in the Excel ribbon
2. Look for the **Insert Statistic Chart** button (icon shows a histogram)
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to it
4. Select **Box and Whisker** from the chart options

**Screenshot description:** The Insert Statistic Chart menu showing Histogram, Pareto, Box and Whisker, Waterfall, Funnel, and Stock chart options.

Excel will generate a basic box plot, but it probably doesn't look perfect yet.

### Step 4: Customize Your Box Plot

Excel's default box plot often needs adjustment. Right-click on the chart to access customization options:

**Chart Title:**
1. Click the chart title
2. Type a descriptive title like "Test Score Distribution Analysis"

**Axis Labels:**
1. Click the **+** icon next to your chart
2. Check **Axis Titles**
3. Edit both horizontal and vertical axis labels
4. Vertical axis: "Score Values"
5. Horizontal axis: "Test Groups"

**Color Customization:**
1. Right-click any box in the plot
2. Select **Format Data Series**
3. Choose **Fill & Line** options
4. Change colors to match your presentation or report theme

### Step 5: Adjust Box Plot Settings

Excel offers specific box plot configuration options:

1. Right-click on the boxes (data series)
2. Select **Format Data Series**
3. In the sidebar, look for **Series Options**

**Key settings to adjust:**

**Show inner points:** Check this to display all individual data points inside the box plot

**Show outlier points:** Displays data points that fall outside the whiskers (recommended for identifying anomalies)

**Show mean markers:** Adds a marker showing the mean value (different from median)

**Show mean line:** Connects mean values across multiple datasets

**Quartile calculation:** Choose between "Inclusive median" or "Exclusive median" (Excel default is exclusive)

### Step 6: Fine-Tune Your Chart

Polish your box and whisker chart with these final adjustments:

**Gridlines:**
- Click the **+** icon
- Check/uncheck **Gridlines** for better readability

**Legend:**
- Position the legend at top, bottom, left, or right
- Or remove it entirely if column labels are sufficient

**Chart Style:**
- Use the paintbrush icon to apply pre-designed styles
- Match your corporate branding or report requirements

## Understanding Your Excel Box Plot

Once created, your box and whisker plot displays five key statistics (the "five-number summary"):

- **Minimum:** The lower whisker endpoint (excluding outliers)
- **Q1 (First Quartile):** Bottom of the box (25th percentile)
- **Median (Q2):** Line inside the box (50th percentile)
- **Q3 (Third Quartile):** Top of the box (75th percentile)
- **Maximum:** Upper whisker endpoint (excluding outliers)
- **Outliers:** Individual points beyond the whiskers

## Common Excel Box Plot Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: "Box and Whisker" Option is Grayed Out

**Cause:** You're using Excel 2013 or earlier, or your data isn't properly selected.

**Solution:**
- Verify you have Excel 2016 or later
- Ensure you've selected numerical data only
- Remove any text values from selected cells

### Problem 2: Chart Looks Weird or Incomplete

**Cause:** Empty cells, text in data range, or insufficient data points.

**Solution:**
- Fill or remove empty cells in your dataset
- Ensure all values are numbers, not text
- Have at least 5 data points per series

### Problem 3: Can't Customize Specific Elements

**Cause:** Clicking the wrong chart element.

**Solution:**
- Click directly on the specific box/whisker you want to format
- Use the **Format** tab that appears when chart is selected
- Check the dropdown menu to select exact chart elements

### Problem 4: Outliers Not Showing

**Cause:** "Show outlier points" option is disabled.

**Solution:**
- Right-click the data series
- Format Data Series > Series Options
- Check "Show outlier points"

### Problem 5: Box Plot Updates Incorrectly

**Cause:** Data range is hardcoded, not dynamic.

**Solution:**
- Right-click chart > Select Data
- Edit data range to include new rows/columns
- Consider using Excel Tables for automatic range expansion

## Excel Box Plot Limitations You Should Know

While Excel can create box and whisker plots, it has significant drawbacks:

Record a macro while creating a box plot to automate repetitive formatting tasks.

### Tip 5: Power Query Integration
Use Power Query to clean and transform data before creating box plots, ensuring consistent data quality.

## Box Plot Best Practices (Excel or Online)

Regardless of which tool you choose, follow these visualization best practices:

**Data Preparation:**
- Remove obvious data entry errors before plotting
- Document data sources and collection methods
- Keep raw data separate from calculated values

**Visual Design:**
- Use distinct colors when comparing multiple groups
- Maintain consistent color schemes across related charts
- Add clear axis labels with units (e.g., "Score (points)")
- Include descriptive chart titles

**Statistical Integrity:**
- Ensure sufficient sample size (minimum 5-10 points per group)
- Report sample sizes alongside box plots
- Note any data transformations applied
- Consider showing both mean and median when they differ significantly

**Accessibility:**
- Use colorblind-friendly palettes
- Provide alternative text descriptions
- Include data tables for screen readers
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I create box plots in Google Sheets?**
A: Google Sheets doesn't have built-in box plot functionality. You'd need to use add-ons or create them manually using formulas and custom charts. A free online tool is much easier.

**Q: How many data points do I need for a box plot?**
A: Technically 5 minimum (for the five-number summary), but 10-20+ data points provide more meaningful visualizations and reliable quartile calculations.

**Q: What's the difference between box plots and histograms?**
A: Box plots show distribution summary statistics (median, quartiles, outliers), while histograms show frequency distribution of values across bins. Box plots are better for comparing groups; histograms for understanding shape of single distributions.

**Q: Can Excel calculate and display the mean on box plots?**
A: Yes, in Format Data Series > Series Options, check "Show mean markers" to display mean values alongside the median line.

**Q: Why do my Excel and online tool box plots look slightly different?**
A: Different tools may use different quartile calculation methods (inclusive vs. exclusive median). Both are statistically valid; the difference is usually minimal.

**Q: Is it better to use horizontal or vertical box plots?**
A: Vertical is standard for most applications. Use horizontal when you have many groups with long names, making vertical labels difficult to read.

## Conclusion: Choose the Right Tool for Your Needs

Creating a box and whisker plot in Excel is certainly possible with Excel 2016 or later, but it requires navigating multiple menus, dealing with limited customization options, and investing 5-10 minutes per chart. For occasional users or those without the latest Excel version, the complexity often outweighs the benefits.
